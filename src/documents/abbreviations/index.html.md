Abbreviations are the heart for Emmet toolkit: these special expressions are parsed in runtime and transformed into structured code block, HTML for example. Abbreviations syntax looks like CSS selectors with a few extensions specific to code generation. So every web-developer already know how to use it. 

Hereâ€™s an example: this abbreviation

	#page>div.logo+ul#navigation>li*5>a{Item $}
	
...can be transformed into

	<div id="page">
		<div class="logo"></div>
		<ul id="navigation">
			<li><a href="">Item 1</a></li>
			<li><a href="">Item 2</a></li>
			<li><a href="">Item 3</a></li>
			<li><a href="">Item 4</a></li>
			<li><a href="">Item 5</a></li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
...with	just a single key stroke. In many editors (Eclipse, Sublime Text 2, Espresso etc.) plugin will also generate proper _tabstop marks_ so you can quickly traverse between important places of generated code with Tab key.

Abbreviations are optimised for, but not limited to, HTML and XML generation and makes writing tedious markup code a breeze. You can start learning [syntax](/abbreviations/syntax/) to unleash the full power of Emmet abbreviations.
